# Ternary Test

- Tested ternary operator with `c` and `cpp`, created `Makefile` for ease of use.

### Requirements

- gcc, g++, make

### How To Run

- Make sure you have [requirements](#requirements) in you computer.

- Open terminal in  project folder (TernaryTest).

- Run make command:

```
make
```

- If make command successfully creates (If not check [requirements](#requirements) again) test and filetest executables:

- Run test executable with:
```
./test 15 25
```

- Output should be:
```
max of 15 and 25 is 25
```

- Run filetest executable with:
```
./filetest output.txt
```

- This executable creates output.txt file and writes `Printing text to somewhere.` in it.
